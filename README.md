# odin-rock-paper-scissors

In this project I utilized JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to reproduce a game of rock, paper, scissors that is played against the computer. The game ends when either the player or computer reaches 5 points. UI features include a start game button, winner declaration at the end of each round, score tracker, final winner declaration, and a play again button.
